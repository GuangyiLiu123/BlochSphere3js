9/16 - Added Parenthesis to correct the complex number representation (nonsensical random floating constant in a quantum state expression), and also fixed Pauli Y, which had an incorrect formula for phi, which is to be rotated, not reflected across the X-Z Axis like it was before.
9/15 - Fixed the Hadamard and replaced the placeholder code, that was initially used for simplicity. Done with conversion to rectangular coordinates and then using Rodrigues' rotation formula.
